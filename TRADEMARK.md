# GeekyGoose Compliance - Trademark Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the trademark policy for the GeekyGoose Compliance project. The purpose of this policy is to clarify what you can and cannot do with the GeekyGoose name, logo, and other trademarks.

**TL;DR**: You may freely use, modify, and distribute the **code** under the AGPLv3 license, but you generally may **not use our name or logo** without permission.

## What This Policy Covers

This policy covers the following trademarks (collectively, "GeekyGoose Marks"):
- The "GeekyGoose" name
- The "GeekyGoose Compliance" name
- The GeekyGoose logo and any variations
- The duck/goose imagery associated with the project
- Any other marks or logos we designate as trademarks

## Code vs. Trademarks: A Key Distinction

### ✅ The Code is Freely Licensed
The **source code** of GeekyGoose Compliance is licensed under AGPLv3. This means:
- You can use, study, modify, and distribute the code
- You can create derivative works
- You can use it for commercial purposes (subject to AGPLv3 terms)
- You can fork the project

### ⚠️ The Name and Logo are NOT Freely Licensed
The **GeekyGoose name, logo, and trademarks** are NOT covered by the AGPLv3 license. This means:
- You generally cannot use our name or logo without permission
- This prevents confusion about what is "official" vs. community versions
- This protects the reputation and identity of the project

## What You CAN Do (Without Permission)

### 1. Use the Code
- Install, run, modify, and distribute the software under AGPLv3 terms
- Create derivative works based on the code
- Use the software commercially (with appropriate licensing)

- Write tutorials, blog posts, or documentation that mention GeekyGoose

### 3. Community Discussion
- Discuss the project in forums, social media, and community channels
- Write reviews or comparisons mentioning GeekyGoose
- Create educational content about the software

## What You CANNOT Do (Without Permission)

### 1. Use the Name or Logo to Represent Your Own Product
- Do not call your fork or derivative work "GeekyGoose" or "GeekyGoose [Anything]"
- Do not use the GeekyGoose logo as your product logo
- Do not create modified versions of the logo

### 2. Imply Official Endorsement
- Do not suggest your product or service is officially endorsed by GeekyGoose
- Do not claim your modifications are "official" versions
- Do not use the marks in a way that suggests affiliation without permission

### 3. Commercial Use of the Marks
- Do not use the name or logo in your company name
- Do not register domain names containing "GeekyGoose" (except for fan sites, with permission)
- Do not use the marks in a way that could cause confusion in the marketplace

### 4. Trademark Registration
- Do not register GeekyGoose marks or similar marks as your own trademarks
- Do not file for trademark protection on similar or confusingly similar names

## How to Use GeekyGoose Marks Properly

If you want to reference GeekyGoose in your project, here are some guidelines:

### ✅ GOOD Examples
- "MyComplianceTool, built using GeekyGoose Compliance technology"
- "A compliance management system based on GeekyGoose Compliance"
- "ComplianceCloud - Powered by GeekyGoose Compliance"
- "Tutorial: How to integrate with GeekyGoose Compliance"

### ❌ BAD Examples
- "GeekyGoose Enterprise Edition" (implies it's an official version)
- "GeekyGoose Pro" (sounds like an official product)
- Using the GeekyGoose logo as your product logo
- "Official GeekyGoose Hosting Service" (without permission)
