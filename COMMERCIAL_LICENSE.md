## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I try before purchasing?
Yes! Use the AGPLv3 version for evaluation. Once you're ready to deploy commercially, contact us for licensing.

### What happens if I start with AGPLv3 and later want a commercial license?
You can upgrade to a commercial license at any time. Contact us to discuss migration and pricing.

### Do I need a commercial license for internal use?
Not necessarily. If you're using GeekyGoose Compliance internally within your organization and not providing it as a service to others, AGPLv3 may be sufficient. However, if you modify the software, you must provide source code to your users under AGPLv3.

### Can I get a commercial license for specific features only?
Yes, we can provide customized licensing arrangements. Contact us to discuss your needs.
