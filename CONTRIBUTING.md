## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local frontend development)
- Python 3.11+ (for local backend development)
- Git

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geekygoose-compliance.git
cd geekygoose-compliance

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize database
docker-compose exec api python create_tables.py
docker-compose exec api python seed_database.py
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend Development
```bash
cd apps/api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

### Worker Development
```bash
cd apps/api
celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### **Code Style**

#### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`
- **TypeScript strict mode**: All code must pass strict type checking
- **Component structure**: Use functional components with hooks
- **File naming**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components

#### Python (Backend)
- **Black formatter**: Run `black .` for consistent formatting
- **Type hints**: Use Python type hints for all function parameters and returns
- **Docstrings**: Follow Google style docstrings
- **Import order**: Use `isort` for consistent import ordering

### **Testing Requirements**

#### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd apps/web
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage   # Generate coverage report
```

#### Backend Tests
```bash
cd apps/api
python -m pytest                    # Run all tests
python -m pytest --cov=.           # Run with coverage
python -m pytest -v tests/         # Verbose output
```

#### Integration Tests
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

### **Database Changes**
- **Always create migrations** for database schema changes
- **Test migrations** both up and down
- **Seed data changes** should be backward compatible

```bash
# Create migration
docker-compose exec api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new table"

# Apply migration
docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head

# Downgrade migration (if needed)
docker-compose exec api alembic downgrade -1
```

## 📝 Pull Request Process

### 1. **Before Starting**
- **Create an issue** or comment on existing issues to discuss the change

### 2. **Branch Naming**
```bash
feature/add-iso27001-support
bugfix/fix-scan-timeout-issue
docs/update-api-documentation
chore/update-dependencies
```

### 3. **Commit Messages**
Use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
- **Squash commits** before merging (maintainers will handle this)

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Next.js App Router**: Use server components where possible
- **State Management**: React Context for global state, useState for local
- **API Calls**: Use TanStack Query for data fetching
- **UI Components**: Build on shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with consistent design tokens

### **Backend Architecture**
- **FastAPI**: Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic migrations
- **Background Jobs**: Celery with Redis for async tasks
- **File Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible) for document storage
- **Security**: JWT authentication with role-based access

### **AI Integration**
- **Provider Agnostic**: Support both OpenAI API and local Ollama
- **Structured Output**: Use Pydantic models for AI response validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable
- **Privacy**: Configurable data retention and processing policies

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- **Frontend**: React Testing Library + Jest
- **Backend**: pytest with fixtures
- **Coverage Target**: >80% for new code
- **Test Structure**: Arrange, Act, Assert pattern

### **Integration Tests**
- **API Endpoints**: Test full request/response cycles
- **Database**: Test migrations and data integrity
- **File Processing**: Test document upload and extraction
- **AI Pipeline**: Test end-to-end compliance scanning

### **E2E Tests**
- **User Workflows**: Critical paths like upload → scan → report
- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- **Performance**: Page load times and API response times

## 🐛 Bug Triage

### **Severity Levels**
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, system crashes
- **High**: Major functionality broken, blocking workflows
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, poor UX
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, nice-to-have improvements

### **Priority Labels**
- **P0**: Fix immediately (security, data loss)
- **P1**: Fix in current sprint (blocking features)
- **P2**: Fix in next release (important improvements)
- **P3**: Fix when time permits (minor issues)

## 📊 Performance Guidelines

### **Frontend Performance**
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize JavaScript bundles
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component
- **Caching**: Implement proper browser and CDN caching

### **Backend Performance**
- **API Response Times**: < 200ms for simple queries, < 2s for complex
- **Database Queries**: Use proper indexes, avoid N+1 queries
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and optimize memory consumption
- **Concurrent Users**: Test with realistic load scenarios

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### **Security Best Practices**
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries only
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user content, use CSP headers
- **Authentication**: Implement proper session management
- **Authorization**: Check permissions on every API call
- **File Uploads**: Validate file types and scan for malware

### **Dependency Management**
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Security Scanning**: Use tools like `npm audit` and `safety`
