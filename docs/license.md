#### ⚠️ You MUST (Under AGPLv3):

- **Provide source code** to users if you run it as a network service
- **License modifications** under AGPLv3
- **Preserve copyright notices** and license information
- **Make source available** to anyone who uses your networked version

#### Perfect For:

- 🏢 **Internal company use** (self-hosted)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use GeekyGoose Compliance for free?

**Yes!** The Community Edition is free under AGPLv3. You can use it for internal company use, personal projects, education, and more.

### What triggers the need for source code disclosure?

If you run GeekyGoose Compliance as a **network service** (e.g., web application accessible to users over the internet) and you've **modified the code**, you must provide the source code to those users under AGPLv3.

### Can I use it internally without sharing source code?

**Yes**, if you're using it purely internally (not as a service to external users), you don't need to share your modifications. However, AGPLv3 best practices suggest transparency.

### What if I want to offer compliance-as-a-service to clients?

You would need a **commercial license** if you don't want to provide your source code to your clients. This is the most common reason companies choose the commercial license.

### Can I evaluate before purchasing a commercial license?

**Absolutely!** Use the AGPLv3 version for evaluation, testing, and proof of concept. When you're ready to deploy commercially, contact us for licensing.

### What happens if I start with AGPLv3 and later need commercial?

You can **upgrade to a commercial license** at any time. We'll work with you to ensure a smooth transition.

### Can I get support with the Community Edition?

Community Edition includes:
- 📖 Public documentation
- 💬 GitHub Discussions
- 🐛 Issue tracker
- 📧 Community forum

Commercial licenses include priority support with SLAs.
