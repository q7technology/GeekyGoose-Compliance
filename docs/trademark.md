# Trademark Policy

## TL;DR

**Code is free. Name and logo are not.**

You may freely use, modify, and distribute the **code** under the AGPLv3 license, but you generally may **not use our name or logo** without permission.

---

## Overview

This document outlines the trademark policy for the GeekyGoose Compliance project. The purpose is to clarify what you can and cannot do with the GeekyGoose name, logo, and other trademarks.

## Code vs. Trademarks: A Key Distinction

- ✅ You can **create derivative works**
- ✅ You can **use it for commercial purposes** (subject to AGPLv3 terms)
- ✅ You can **fork** the project
