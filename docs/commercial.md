# Commercial License

Get GeekyGoose Compliance without AGPLv3 obligations for your commercial use cases.

---

## Overview

This Commercial License is an alternative to the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) for GeekyGoose Compliance. Organizations that wish to use, modify, or distribute GeekyGoose Compliance **without the obligations of AGPLv3** may purchase a commercial license.

## When You Need a Commercial License

You need a commercial license if you want to:

### 🏢 Run as a Hosted/SaaS Service
Provide GeekyGoose Compliance as a service to your customers without disclosing your source code modifications.

**Example:** ComplianceCloud wants to offer compliance management to their customers using GeekyGoose Compliance as the backend, with custom integrations and features.

### 🔒 Keep Modifications Private
Modify the software for your proprietary product without open-sourcing your changes.

**Example:** SecureOps wants to integrate GeekyGoose Compliance into their security platform with custom features they don't want to share.

### 📦 Embed in Proprietary Software
Include GeekyGoose Compliance as part of your commercial product offering.

**Example:** EnterpriseSuite wants to bundle GeekyGoose Compliance with their enterprise management software.

### ⚖️ Avoid Copyleft Obligations
Use the software commercially without any AGPLv3 license requirements.

**Example:** StartupCo wants legal certainty and no open-source compliance burden.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I try before purchasing?

**Yes!** Use the AGPLv3 version for evaluation, testing, and proof of concept. Once you're ready to deploy commercially, contact us for licensing.

We recommend:
1. Deploy the Community Edition
2. Test with your workflows
3. Evaluate fit for your needs
